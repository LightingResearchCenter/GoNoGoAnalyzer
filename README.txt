To run the GoNoGo Analyzer, simply open up a python interpreter and run processdata.py
processdata.py creates a graphical widget (cross platform) which takes 2-3 arguments.
Each argument is labeled, e.g. "Audio Results Directory" or "Save Path" - explained below.

	Audio Results Directory:
	The top level directory where results from an audio test are stored.

	GoNoGo Results Directory:
	The top level directory where results from a GoNoGo test are stored.

	Save Path:
	Where you would like the data to be outputted.

Beneath each results directory there must be at least one "Condition" directory. 
Condition would either be the condition the experiment was taken in, e.g. daylight
or if not applicable should be named something reasonable e.g. L&H Experiment One

Finally, in each condition directory there must be at least one result file.
Result files are generated by the audio and GoNoGo programs and are named
"GONOGO_Subject <integer>_Session <integer>_Trial <integer>.txt"
Note: If a file is incomplete for whatever reason, the program may not run properly.

Subjects need not be indexed at 1, nor must they be sequential i.e. you may start
with subject 12 and omit subjects 13 and 14, continuing with subject 15.

Sessions and Trials need not be indexed at 1, but it is strongly suggested that
they are. If they are not, there may be some formatting errors, and there may be
unforeseen issues.

Similarly, Sessions and trials should be sequential.
